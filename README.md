## Dataset


This data consisted of 183412 bike trips recorded in the dataset with 16 features recorder per trip. These features cover the these areas:
* time of the ride 
* the location of the ride  
* information about the bike and it's rider


## Summary of Findings

 I explored the trip data of 183,412 trips of ford gobike sustainable bike sharing system in the San-Fransisco Bay area. During this analysis, I focused on the duration of the trips explored how other features affect this. I explored the relationship of features like `user_type`, `members age`,	`member_gender`, `period of day (day/night)` with trip durations.

> At the end of the this process, I noted the following:

* Bike durations are mostly less than 40 minutes 
* There are more subscribers than customers but customers take longer trips
* A large number of the riders below 50 years have high number of trip duration some well above 80000 sec (22 hours)
* That female and other gender members take longer trip durations than male members
* That trips last longer on weekends (sat, sun) and afternoons. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on just the influence of the features `user_type`, `members age`,	`member_gender`, `period of day (day/night)`. I start by introducing the duration variable, plotting the scatteplot. Followed by the pattern in user_type.

Afterwards, I introduce each of the categorical variables and how the relate to duration. To start,
I used the box plots of duration against `user_type`, `members age`, `member_gender`, `weekday` and `trip_period`.
have also considered how the duration of trips during the weekend affects the user_type and gender
